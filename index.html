                    basic
                    to a professional level and after learning HTML with CSS and JavaScript you will be able to create
                    your
                    own interactive and dynamic website. But Now We will focus on HTML only in this tutorial.</p>
                <p>The major points of HTML are given below:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.</li>
                    <li>HTML is used to create web pages and web applications.</li>
                    <li>HTML is widely used language on the web.</li>
                    <li>We can create a static website by HTML only</li>

                    What is HTML
                </header>

                <p>
                    HTML is an acronym which stands for
                    <strong>
                        Hyper Text Markup Language
                    </strong>
                    which is used for creating web pages and web applications.
                    Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Hyper Text:
                    </strong>
                    HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext.
                    Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext.
                    HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Markup language:
                    </strong>
                    A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting
                    conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic.
                    It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Web Page:
                    </strong>
                    A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated
                    by a web browser.
                    A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type.
                    <strong>
                        With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.
                    </strong>

                    HTML Text Editors
                </header>

                <ul>
                    <li>An HTML file is a text file, so to create an HTML file we can use any text editors.</li>
                    <li>Text editors are the programs which allow editing in a written text, hence to create a web page
                        we
                        need to write our code in some text editor. </li>
                    <li>There are various types of text editors available which you can directly download, but for a
                        beginner, the best text editor is Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac). </li>
                    <li>After learning the basics, you can easily use other professional text editors which are,
                        <strong>
                            Notepad++,
                            Sublime Text, Vim, etc.</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>In our tutorial, we will use Notepad and sublime text editor. Following are some easy ways to

                    HTML Building Blocks
                </header>

                <p>An HTML document consist of its basic building blocks which are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tags: An HTML tag surrounds the content and apply meaning to it. It is written between &#60 and
                        &#62
                        brackets.</li>
                    <li>Attribute: An attribute in HTML provides extra information about the element, and it is applied
                        within the start tag. An HTML attribute contains two fields: name & value.</li>
                    <li>Elements: An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML file. In an HTML file,
                        everything
                        written within tags are termed as HTML elements.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="HTML_Tags">
                <header>
                    HTML Tags
                </header>

                <p>HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content.
                    With
                    the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML
                    tags
                    contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed
                    tags.
                </p>
                <p>When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right.
                    HTML
                    tags are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different
                    properties.</p>
                <p>An HTML file must have some essential tags so that web browser can differentiate between a simple
                    text
                    and HTML text. You can use as many tags you want as per your code requirement.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>All HTML tags must enclosed within &#60 &#62 these brackets. </li>
                    <li>Every tag in HTML perform different tasks. </li>
                    <li>If you have used an open tag &#60 tag &#62, then you must use a close tag &#60 /tag &#62 (except
                        some tags)</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Unclosed HTML tags</h5>
                <p>Some HTML tags are not closed, for example br and hr.</p>
                <p><strong> &#60br&#62 Tag:</strong> br stands for break line, it breaks the line of the code.</p>
                <p><strong> &#60hr&#62 Tag:</strong> hr stands for Horizontal Rule. This tag is used to put a line
                    across
                    the webpage.</p>
                <hr>

                    HTML Attributes
                </header>

                <ul>
                    <li>HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or
                        attributes are the modifier of the HTML element. </li>
                    <li>Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element. </li>
                    <li>Attributes should always be applied with start tag. </li>
                    <li>The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair. </li>
                    <li>The Attributes name and values are case sensitive, and it is recommended by W3C that it should
                        be
                        written in Lowercase only. </li>
                    <li>You can add multiple attributes in one HTML element, but need to give space between two
                        attributes.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5>The title attribute in HTML</h5>
                <p>Description: The title attribute is used as text tooltip in most of the browsers. It display its text
                    when user move the cursor over a link or any text. You can use it with any text or link to show the
                    description about that link or text. In our example, we are taking this with paragraph tag and
                    heading
                    tag. </p>

                <h5>The href attribute in HTML</h5>
                <p>Description: The href attribute is the main attribute of &#60a&#62 anchor tag. This attribute gives
                    the
                    link
                    address which is specified in that link. The href attribute provides the hyperlink, and if it is
                    blank, then it will remain in same page.</p>

                <h5>The src Attribute</h5>
                <p>The src attribute is one of the important and required attribute of &#60img&#62 element. It is source
                    for
                    the
                    image which is required to display on browser. This attribute can contain image in same directory or
                    another directory. The image name or source should be correct else browser will not display the
                    image.
                </p>

                    HTML Elements
                </header>
                <p>An HTML file is made of elements. These elements are responsible for creating web pages and define
                    content in that webpage. An element in HTML usually consist of a start tag &#60tag name&#62, close
                    tag
                    &#60/tag name&#62 and content inserted between them. Technically, an element is a collection of
                    start
                    tag,
                    attributes, end tag, content between them.</p>

                <h5>Block-level and Inline HTML elements</h5>
                <p>For the default display and styling purpose in HTML, all the elements are divided into two
                    categories:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Block-Level Element</li>
                    <li>Inline Element</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Block-level element:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>These are the elements, which structure main part of web page, by dividing a page into coherent
                        blocks. </li>
                    <li>A block-level element always start with new line and takes the full width of web page, from left
                        to
                        right. </li>

                    format text without using CSS. There are many formatting tags in HTML. These tags are used to make
                    text
                    bold, italicized, or underlined. There are almost 14 options available that how text appears in HTML

                    HTML Heading
                </header>

                <p> A HTML heading or HTML h tag can be defined as a title or a subtitle which you want to display on
                    the
                    webpage. When you place the text within the heading tags &#60h1>.........&#60/h1>, it is displayed
                    on
                    the browser in the bold format and size of the text depends on the number of heading. </p>
                <p>There are six different HTML headings which are defined with the &#60h1> to &#60h6> tags, from
                    highest
                    level h1 (main heading) to the least level h6 (least important heading). </p>
                <p>h1 is the largest heading tag and h6 is the smallest one. So h1 is used for most important heading
                    and h6
                    is used for least important.</p>

                </header>

                <p>HTML paragraph or HTML p tag is used to define a paragraph in a webpage. Let's take a simple example
                    to
                    see how it work. It is a notable point that a browser itself add an empty line before and after a
                    paragraph. An HTML
                <p> tag indicates starting of new paragraph.</p>

                <h5>Space inside HTML Paragraph</h5>
                <p>If you put a lot of spaces inside the HTML p tag, browser removes extra spaces and extra line while
                    displaying the page. The browser counts number of spaces and lines as a single one.</p>

                <p>An HTML &#60br> tag is used for line break and it can be used with paragraph elements. Following is
                    the
                    example to show how to use &#60br> with
